ðŸŒŸ APP: Make Netflix

Here we have the Netflix app but it's up to you to make it work by pulling all the movies using an API!

Create a fetchMovies() function that will make a dynamic API call to what you need ðŸ‘‡
========================================

- fetchMovies()

** fetchMovies takes in an URL, a div id or class from the HTML, and a path (poster or backdrop)



These are the 3 main functions and their URL'S you must create  ðŸ‘‡
========================================

- getOriginals()
  * URL : 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/tv?api_key=19f84e11932abbc79e6d83f82d6d1045&with_networks=213'

- getTrendingNow()
  * URL : 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/trending/movie/week?api_key=19f84e11932abbc79e6d83f82d6d1045'

- getTopRated()
  * URL : 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/top_rated?api_key=19f84e11932abbc79e6d83f82d6d1045&language=en-US&page=1'


** These functions will provide the URL you need to fetch() movies of that genere **

These are all the DIV ID's you're gonna need access to ðŸ‘‡
========================================================
#1 CLASS ðŸ‘‰ 'original__movies' = Div that holds Netflix Originals
#2 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'trending' = Div that holds trending Movies
#3 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'top_rated' = Div that holds top rated Movies
